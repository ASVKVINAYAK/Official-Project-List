## 2017 List

## Minor


* ### Browser plugin/extension to logout of all logged in accounts in one click.


* ### A system that can show ICC World Championships Trophy, Twenty20, IPL, or FIFA Worldcup, FIFA Women's World Cup, ISL statistics for a player for a given year.

* ### Facebook Messenger ChatBot, for basic interaction, getting instant news by providing queries, reminders, weather notifications, hazard news notifications, fun games like trivia, and a casino system with games like coin flip, blackjack and dice, where the user can bet a specific amount of money.

## MAJOR

## ACM Student Chapter List 2016-17

* ### Information Security using Steganography over Cryptography

**Description**: Cryptography is technique of disguising the data or making data unintelligent to the intruder or hacker. Steganography is a technique of hiding data into a cover medium. At the initial stage, encryption of original data should take place using some cryptographic algorithm.  Subsequently the encrypted message is hidden into some cover medium such as image using Steganography. After transmission of the image, reverse Steganography and decryption should be performed on the receiver end.

Prerequisites: Python (OpenCV)/Matlab. OpenCV library has bindings in other languages too.

Difficulty: Intermediate (3/5).

Additional Information: Originally proposed in IIT Bombay eGURU programme.


* ### [Fedora Electronic Lab] Develop a script which translates Modelsim.do file into a gtkwave tcl script

**Description**:  Create a Tcl script that converts Modelsim.do files into .do files which GTKwave can understand. Thus you will need to create a Tcl script, which takes in  as input a Modelsim .do file and output a Tcl script which GTKwave will read. It is basically a script which maps/modifies Modelsim commands into GTKwave commands.

Prerequisites: Tcl/Python

Difficulty: Easy (2/5). Good for beginners.

Resources: http://gtkwave.sourceforge.net /gtkwave.pdf (The Appendix sections are relevant).


* ### Linux From Scratch

**Description**: Compile and assemble a GNU/Linux Operating System from source code.

Prerequisites: None. You will learn about GNU build systems in the process. Knowledge of Bash will help.

Difficulty: Easy (1/5)

Additional Information: See linuxfromscratch.org


* ### Implementing a database in C/C++/Java/Python 

**Description**: Create a simple DBMS from scratch that can create tables, and insert update and delete values.

Prerequisites: General coding

Preferred Language: Java/C++/Python/Or any language of your choice


* ### DBMS GUI Interface (Multithreaded) 

**Description**: Implement a application that formulates a query from user data, sends it to a relational DBMS and returns the result.

Prerequisites: Java/C++/Python/Or any language of your choice

Difficulty: ?


* ### Web Crawling, Parsing and Processing  

**Description**: Create a web crawler that crawls on a particular website(say,www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/en cyclopedia.html), ranks it and searches it for user provided inputs.

Prerequisites: Regular Expressions. 

Preferred Language: Any scripting language of your choice (preferably Python/PERL).


* ### NLP - Search Wikipedia through command line 

**Description**: similar as above but it returns the summary of user queries and is to be implemented in command line

Skill or prerequisite knowledge: General coding 

Preferred Language:  preferably Python/Perl or any scripting language of your choice. Also  requires a Natural language Processing library like NLTK in Python


* ### Parsing datasets and real-time plotting. 

**Description**: Use a openly available real-time dataset like Sensex and plot it.

[Clarification needed here: The dataset is real-time, but not the plotting. Plotting real-time is much more complex and will require access to data spouts. This can be an interesting project as well]

Skills or prerequisite knowledge: General coding

Preferred Language: Python/R/Matlab


* ### Image processing 

**Description**: removing noise, implementing software filters, etc (needs specification)

Skills or prerequisite knowledge: General coding

Preferred Language: preferably Python/Matlab/OpenCV.  Bit difficult with other languages but can be done.


* ### DSP 

**Description**: Add noise to an audio file and remove it through application of different filters

Skills or prerequisite knowledge: General coding

Preferred Language: preferably Python/Matlab . Bit difficult with other languages but can be   done.


* ### Cryptography

**Description**: Implementing AES, MD5, and SHA1 functions

Skills or prerequisite knowledge: General coding

Preferred Language: Java/C++/Python/Or any language of your choice


* ### Implementation of genetic algorithm / related evolutionary algorithm

Skills or prerequisite knowledge: General coding

Preferred Language: preferably Python/Matlab/R. Bit difficult with other languages but can be done.


* ### Creating a text editor 

**Description**: text editor with text management features like - notes, reminders, auto save, web-api's

Skills or prerequisite knowledge: General coding

Preferred Language: preferably C++/java/Python or any language of your choice
